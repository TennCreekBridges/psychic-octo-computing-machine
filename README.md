# INTRODUCTION
This is a simple page which uses JavaScript to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. It features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive.

The user needs a new and secure password. The Generate Password button is clicked, and the user is prompted for password length. The password must be between eight and 128 characters. If the number is less than eight, greater than 128 or not a number they are prompted to enter a valid password length. They are then asked which criteria to include from a pool of (uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers), and if none are selected they are required to try again and select at least one of the inclusion critera.

The password is then generated and written to the page.
